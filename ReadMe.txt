I didnt have enough information about Germany Payments,
 I consider that every person can just have one Credit card,
  but may have many address.

It could be just one table (user Table) and every step it been updated.
 but if our site was an online shopping store it could have address problems.

I set telephone field unique in database because of sending personal messages.
 our registration doesnt have email field and telephone may be used instead of that.

I create helper.php for make using sessions and functions easier.



It could be used cookie instead of inserting step by step,
 but if our site be an advertisement site,
  we will need all the information that user insert in every step 
   and availability of datas will be important.

If i had enough informaion I could set owner acount or IBAN uniqe. or some changes.

Thank you for giving this apportunity.

Best Regard,
Kiana Kazerooni
